# Comparative Analysis of 12-Bit RCA and 12-Bit CSA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comparative study of two digital adders:

- 12-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
- 12-bit Carry Select Adder (CSA)

Both adders are designed using Verilog HDL and analyzed based on delay, area, power, and gate count.
